# My Path Directory


## Hello there 👋, I'm [Tega Rorobi](https://github.com/TegaRorobi), a passionate Software Engineer.


This repository will contain the files, mainly scripts that I have added to my Path environment variable.


It will most likely contain mainly _powershell_ scripts (.ps1 extension) that I use to configure and perform various actions on my  PC, from a terminal.


I decided to create a repository for this as I may write up some nice and useful scripts for various tasks that other people can also use. (I also would like to store these files on GitHub so I don't lose them 😏)


I'll also try to document these files as I go.


If you'd like, give the project a ⭐

Thanks for stopping by, and if you find a file you're able to use and configure to your needs, well, congrats 🥳.

Have a nice day ✌
